## Backup Process
For security reasons, the detailed backup process for private keys is documented in our internal wiki. Only authorized maintainers should perform key backup and rotation procedures.

## Emergency Recovery Process
If the private key needs to be rotated (lost/compromised):

1. Contact repository maintainers immediately at authors@kubeadapt.io
2. Repository maintainers will:
   - Generate new signing key following internal security procedures
   - Update repository with new public key information
   - Keep old public key for verifying existing releases
   - Create security advisory for key transition

## Rotation Schedule

- Emergency rotation: If key is compromised
- Regular rotation: Every 10 years

- New releases: Sign with new key
